# azure-dropbox backend

A very simple, and not particularly pretty, backend to support uploading files to Azure Blob Storage.

**Note** files do not pass through these functions - the frontend uploads directly to Azure. The backend simply determines a filename the frontend is allowed to upload, and provides SAS credentials that the frontend uses to authenticate to Azure.

**Warning** Nothing about this should be considred best practice - the author had not used Azure Storage or Azure Functions before writing this code. They're actually kinda suprised it works at all.

## Azure Pre-requisites

You will need

1. An Azure Storage Account

2. A Container within the Azure Storage Account (the author picked `uploads`, which was not particularly creative)

3. A storage access key for the Azure Storage Account.

## Testing locally

1. Start by reading up on Azure Functions & Visual Studio Code.

2. Copy `local.settings.json.example` to `local.settings.json` and update the values for each entry in `Values` (except for `AzureWebJobsStorage` which should be left blank, and `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` which should remain at `node`)

## Deploy

From scatch? ü§∑üèª

Start by creating an Azure App Service (target Linux, node.js 12), and then open this folder in VS Code, installing the "Azure Functions" extension if required. From there you can `Deploy to Function App` to update - the first time you'll be prompted to authenticate, and then choose your application to deploy to.

## TODO

Link to Azure Functions info, especially getting started stuff.
